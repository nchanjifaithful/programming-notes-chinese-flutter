# Programming Notes
**Java** / **Kotlin** / **Flutter(Dart)** Programming Notes

## Java
* Java Design Patterns
     It is generally believed that there are 23 design patterns in Java. Of course, it is not necessary to know all of them for the time being, but several common design patterns should be mastered.
     Generally speaking, design patterns can be divided into three categories:
   * Creational patterns, five types in total: [Factory Method Pattern](/java/设计模式-工厂模式.md), [Abstract Factory Pattern](/java/设计模式-抽象工厂模式.md), [Singleton Pattern ](java/设计模式-单例模式.md), [builder pattern](/java/设计模式-建造者模式.md), [prototype pattern](/java/设计模式-原型模式.md).
   * Structural mode, a total of seven types: [adapter mode](/java/设计模式-适配器模式.md), [decorator mode](/java/设计模式-装饰模式.md), [proxy mode](/java/设计模式-代理模式.md), Appearance Mode, Bridge Mode, Composite Mode, Flyweight Mode.
   * Behavioral patterns, a total of eleven types: strategy pattern, template method pattern, [observer pattern](/java/设计模式-观察者模式.md), iterative sub-pattern, chain of responsibility pattern, command pattern, memo pattern, State pattern, visitor pattern, mediator pattern, interpreter pattern.
* [The difference between Stack and Heap](/java/Stack栈和Heap堆的区别.md)
* [The difference between List-Set-Map and other collections](/java/List-Set-Map等集合的区别.md)
* [How many bytes are occupied by byte-boolean-short-char-int-float-long-double in Java](/java/Java中byte-boolean-short-char-int-float-long-double各占多少字节.md)

## Flutter
* [Book: FlutterInAction - Xianyu Best Practices.pdf](/flutter/FlutterInAction.pdf)
* [Study notes 1 Widgets](/flutter/widgets.md)
* [The key to distinguishing Flutter from other technologies](/flutter/Flutter区别于其他技术的关键.md)
## Android
* [Several ways of Android inter-process communication](/android/Android进程间通信的几种方式.md)
* [Android implements non-blocking Socket communication](/android/Android实现非阻塞Socket通信.md)
* [Android WebSocket implements instant messaging function](/android/Android-WebSocket实现即时通讯功能.md)
