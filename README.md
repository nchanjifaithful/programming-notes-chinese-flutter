**Java** / **Kotlin** / **Flutter(Dart)** Programming Notes

## Java
* Java Design Patterns
     It is generally believed that there are 23 design patterns in Java. Of course, it is not necessary to know all of them for the time being, but several common design patterns should be mastered.
     Generally speaking, design patterns can be divided into three categories:
   * Creational patterns, five types in total: [Factory Method Pattern](/java/Design Pattern-Factory Pattern.md), [Abstract Factory Pattern](/java/Design Pattern-Abstract Factory Pattern.md), [Singleton Pattern ](java/design pattern-singleton pattern.md), [builder pattern](/java/design pattern-builder pattern.md), [prototype pattern](/java/design pattern-prototype pattern.md).
   * Structural mode, a total of seven types: [adapter mode](/java/design mode-adapter mode.md), [decorator mode](/java/design mode-decoration mode.md), [proxy mode](/ java/Design Mode-Proxy Mode.md), Appearance Mode, Bridge Mode, Composite Mode, Flyweight Mode.
   * Behavioral patterns, a total of eleven types: strategy pattern, template method pattern, [observer pattern] (/java/design pattern-observer pattern.md), iterative sub-pattern, chain of responsibility pattern, command pattern, memo pattern, State pattern, visitor pattern, mediator pattern, interpreter pattern.
* [The difference between Stack and Heap](/java/The difference between Stack and Heap.md)
* [The difference between List-Set-Map and other collections](/java/List-Set-Map and other collections.md)
* [How many bytes are occupied by byte-boolean-short-char-int-float-long-double in Java](How many words are occupied by byte-boolean-short-char-int-float-long-double in /java/Java section.md)

## Flutter
